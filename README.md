# Dafne dataset managing app

This is internal part of the dafne project,
part of my (Javier J. Clavijo) academic research.

dafne stands for "Dispalcement As Features on Neural nEtworks".

this app reads from a database with GNSS coordinates series, and issues
some transformations for dataset augmentation.

Hopely the rest of the research will be available soon-ish.
